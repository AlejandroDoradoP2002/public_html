    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a junior student at the University of North Florida with a growing interest in cybersecurity. Currently, I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, although I have a strong grasp of languages like Java, C, and Python. I'm in the process of delving deeper into cybersecurity, and my knowledge in this area is still basic.</p>
        <p>As a member of the Osprey Security Club (OSEC), I actively engage in activities that help me enhance my skills and knowledge in cybersecurity. My goal is to continue learning and growing in this field, with the hope of becoming a valuable professional in the cybersecurity industry in the future.</p>
